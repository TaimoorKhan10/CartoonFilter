# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new in your web browser
2. Enter the following information:
   - Repository name: `CartoonFilter` 
   - Description: `An advanced image processing application that transforms photos into cartoon-style images`
   - Choose "Public" visibility
   - DO NOT check any of the options to initialize the repository with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Local Code

After creating the repository, you'll see a "Quick setup" page. Follow these steps to push your existing local code:

1. Open your terminal (you're already in the correct directory)
2. Run the following command to push your code:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. If prompted for authentication, enter:
   - Username: your GitHub username (taimoorkhan10)
   

## Step 3: Verify Your Upload

1. After pushing successfully, go to https://github.com/taimoorkhan10/CartoonFilter
2. You should see all your files and the professional README with images, badges, and formatting

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors while pushing, try these commands:

1. Confirm your remote is correctly set:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/taimoorkhan10/CartoonFilter.git
   ```

2. Try pushing with your credentials in the URL:
   ```

   ```
   Then push again:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Next Steps After Uploading

Once your project is on GitHub:

1. Enable GitHub Pages to create a project website (optional)
2. Add a project description and topics on your repository page
3. Share the link with others or include it in your resume/portfolio

Your project URL will be: https://github.com/taimoorkhan10/CartoonFilter
